# Weather-Classifier-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Random-Forest  

A machine learning project that applies **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** models to categorize meteorological weather data into **Normal** and **Extreme** classes.  
Includes **source code** and **project documentation (PDF)**.

---

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
**["World Weather Repository (Daily Updating)"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository)**  
by *Nidula Elgiriyewithana*.  

The dataset contains meteorological data from multiple global weather stations, providing valuable features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure for weather classification tasks.

## Objective  

The purpose of this project is to:  
- Develop a **machine learning solution** capable of distinguishing between **normal** and **extreme** weather conditions.  
- Apply **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models to analyze meteorological patterns.  
- Demonstrate the **practical application** of theoretical ML concepts through model training and evaluation.  
- Discuss the **challenges encountered** and explore **potential improvements** for future work.
