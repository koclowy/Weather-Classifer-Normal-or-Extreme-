# 🌦️ Weather Classifier (Normal vs Extreme)

This project applies **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** models to categorize meteorological weather data into **Normal** and **Extreme** classes.

This repository includes the **complete documentation** and **source code** for the project.

## 📘 Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
**["World Weather Repository (Daily Updating)"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository)**  
by *Nidula Elgiriyewithana*.

## 🌍 Problem Statement  

With **climate change** increasingly influencing global weather patterns, the ability to identify and classify **extreme weather conditions** has become vital for environmental monitoring and human safety.  

Out of 19 available project topics, this project focuses specifically on **classifying meteorological data** into **“Normal”** and **“Extreme”** weather categories.

## 🎯 Objective  

The goal of this assignment is to create a ML solution that is capable of accurately distinguishing between normal and extreme weather conditions using meteorological data.  This assignment will describe the step-by-step processes and challenges encountered, followed by a discussion of improvements and suggestions.  This enables us to apply our theoretical knowledge of machine learning to a practical problem.
